# Documentation
ChatEval is a Django application written in Python that uses a *MySQL* database. 

# Structure
Major project settings can be located in `/chateval/settings.py` and core URLs are defined using Regular Expressions in `/chateval/urls.py` and `/app/urls.py`. The core features of ChatEval are part of the `app` Django application within the ChatEval Django project. SQL table definitions in the Django ORM can be found in `/app/auto_models.py` (autogenerated by legacy SQL migration) and `/app/models.py`. Views and their associated logic are located in `/app/views.py`.

# Authentication
User objects are created through Django's `auth` packages and are used as the primary key for the Author objects. Account creation is available at the routes `/accounts/signup` and `/accounts/login`. Logout is available at `/accounts/logout` (as well as from the navbar). Certain views, such as model uploading, are only available when the user is logged in and authenticated. Yes, passwords are hashed before being saved in the database.
